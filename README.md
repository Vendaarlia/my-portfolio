# SnapVision Photography & Marketing Agency Portfolio
___
Welcome to the Photography & Marketing Agency Portfolio project! This repository showcases the work of our agency in both photography and marketing services. We utilize React and the .map() metod to display projects and testimonials from separate data arrays stored in separate files.

## Overview

This project serves as a platform to exhibit our agency's photography projects and client testimonials. Here's a brief overview:

#### src/components: Contains reusable components for displaying projects and testimonials.
#### src/data: Stores separate arrays for projects and testimonials.
#### public: Assets such as images and fonts.

## Role
I am trusted to add frontend features easy to change

### Project goal
I was asked to create a collection and testimonial project that was easy to change the content without damaging the design. Note that it has to be easy and can add as much content as you like and you don't need to understand HTML and CSS. without any additional infrastructure and easy to maintain.

### Solution
To achieve this request, I used the .map() array method to retrieve the content from the JSON file that I prepared to change the array. I also made documentation on how to add content and warnings about what should not be changed in the JSON file. I use an internal data system to prevent the emergence of additional costs, so I use technology that already exists and can be utilized, even though it is not "very easy" to use, there is still effort to use it. 

## Technologies Used

#### React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
#### Tailwind CSS: Styling language for designing the look and feel of the website.

## demo
[SnapVision](https://snapvision-reactmapdata.vercel.app/)

## Usage
### To view the portfolio website locally:

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
